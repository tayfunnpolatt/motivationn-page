            <li>I don't have a preferred religion - I'd have to do research. I was born a Christian, but as I've grown into my own man, I don't attach myself to a religion - 100 per cent, I have faith. Then it's locking into what suits me.</li>
            <li>From the neck up is where you win or lose the battle. It's the art of war. You have to lock yourself in and strategise your mindset. That's why boxers go to training camps: to shut down the noise and really zone in.</li>
            <li>I'll get seven hours sleep a night, but after breakfast, I'll have an hour just resting, to recover. In Spain they all have siestas, even businessmen.</li>
            <li>Boxing's a sport that gives you licence to act like an idiot, I think.</li>
            <li>Boxing is the embodiment of who I am, but beyond that, this is a journey of the self, and my obsession to get the most from this short life.</li>
